				<br>Founded by prospector Ed Schieffelin in 1879, Tombstone became one of the last boomtowns in the American frontier.
				<br>The town grew significantly in the late 1800's, seeing its population rise from 100 to over 14,000 in less than 7 years.
				<br>Today, Tombstone is best known for its gunfight shows at the O.K. Corral and its host of activities reminiscent of a Western era.
				<br>Only a short hour or so out of Gilbert, Tombstone is both a fun and educational experience for all!
